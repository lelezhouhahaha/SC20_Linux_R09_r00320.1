LEGAL ISSUES

In plain English:

1. We don't promise that this software works. (But if you find any bugs, 
please let us know!)

2. You can use this software for whatever you want. You don't have to 
pay us.

3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software. If you use it in a 
program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that 
you've used the IJG code.

In legalese:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or 
implied, with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, 
merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose. This software is 
provided "AS IS", and you, its user, assume the entire risk as to its 
quality and accuracy.

This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane. All Rights 
Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this 
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to 
these conditions:

(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, 
then this README file must be included, with this copyright and 
no-warranty notice unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes 
to the original files must be clearly indicated in accompanying 
documentation.

(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying 
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the 
work of the Independent JPEG Group". 

(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user 
accepts full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the 
authors accept NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG 
code, not just to the unmodified library. If you use our work, you ought 
to acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or 
company name in advertising or publicity relating to this software or 
products derived from it. This software may be referred to only as "the 
Independent JPEG Group's software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the 
basis of commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability 
claims are assumed by the product vendor.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU 
Autoconf. It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely 
distributable. The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, 
config.sub, ltconfig, ltmain.sh). Another support script, install-sh, is 
copyright by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered 
by patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi. Hence arithmetic coding 
cannot legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses. For this 
reason, support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free 
JPEG software. (Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain 
over the unpatented Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many 
implementations will support it.) So far as we are aware, there are no 
patent restrictions on the remaining code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files. 
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support 
has been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to 
produce "uncompressed GIFs". This technique does not use the LZW 
algorithm; the resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are 
readable by all standard GIF decoders.

We are required to state that "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the 
Copyright property of CompuServe Incorporated. GIF(sm) is a Service Mark 
property of CompuServe Incorporated."

combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to which such 
Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation 
against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a 
lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within

any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work 
shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work 
or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without 
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the 
following conditions:

file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the 
Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a 
NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the 
Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative 
Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and 
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the 
NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the 
License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative 
Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE 
text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices 
cannot be construed as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and 
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for 
use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any 
such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and 
distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated 
in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, 
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by 
You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this

responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or 
redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your 
exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, 
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless 
required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent 
acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You 
for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or 
consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this 
License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but 
not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer 
failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or 
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of 
such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the 
Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a 
fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability 
obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in 
accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on 
Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and 
only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor 
harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such 
Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional 
liability.
