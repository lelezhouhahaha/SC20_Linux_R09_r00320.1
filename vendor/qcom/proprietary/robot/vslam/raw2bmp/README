- this is a sample code to convert camera raw image to bmp file 
- dependence: OpenCV 3.1.0 or above
- this sample code was just verified on Ubuntu, it should be work 
  for Windows as well.

- steps to compile on Ubuntu:

1) download OpenCV 3.1.0, see https://www.opencv.org/
2) follow the guide to compile OpenCV, see https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html
3) change the OpenCV_DIR in CMakeLists.txt, for example, "set(OpenCV_DIR "/usr/share/opencv/opencv-3.1.0/build")"
4) cd raw2bmp
5) mkdir build
6) cmake ../
7) make
8) run the application: ./raw2bmp xxx.raw
9) it will see a raw.bmp file is generated, that's the convert bmp file
